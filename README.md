# slack-exporter

A Slack app for exporting messages and file attachments from public and private channels.

Note that Slack provides a similar service for workspace admins at [https://my.slack.com/services/export](https://my.slack.com/services/export) (where `my` can be replaced with your full workspace name to access workspace different than your default). However, it can only access public channels, while `slack-exporter` can be added to any channel.
